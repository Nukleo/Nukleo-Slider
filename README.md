###A jQuery slideshow plugin

This is a simple slideshow plugin that animates each slide's content indenpendently.
- Each slide is composed of 'objects' (html elements) that can be animated when the
slide becomes active and when it is about to go inactive.

- The animation settings are set directly on each element using the data-* properties.

- You can animate anything jQuery's .animate() function can handle. See http://api.jquery.com/animate/
